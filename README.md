# Advanced Asynchrony Summary

## Looking Back

We came into this section with a general understanding of asynchrony and how to
implment one asynchronous model in JavaScript using `fetch()`. Now, at the close
of the section, we not only know how to use it, but exactly how it all works and
why. We dug into building asynchronous processes with XHR, we discovered XHR's
pain points and how to fix them with a new, deeper comprehension of `fetch()`,
and we got up to speed on Promises. We're now ready to create solid, efficient
asynchronous JavaScript code.

## Looking Ahead

We've reached an advanced level of JavaScript, so we now have a wide range of
knowledge that we can incorporate into our programming in the future. Take what
you've gained here to build powerful applications out in the real world.
